**Dataset title:** Independent project for investigation of urbanization impacting genetic diversity in the San Francisco Bay Area

**Dataset curator:** Adriel Evaristo, Boria Lab at SFSU

## Dataset Summary
How does urbanization affect populations? Urbanization is reshaping ecosystems globally, influencing species’
diversity patterns. Urban areas have a higher presence of non-native species and decrease in the abundance
and diversity of native species. These environmental changes due to urbanization are creating new small
populations in small habitats, with unknown impacts on the evolution of life (Johnson and Munshi-South et
al. 2016). By looking at the San Francisco Bay Area through cities in San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose, and
Marin County. There are few studies of how the impact of urbanization is affecting these small habitats to
small mammal species, specifically the Peromyscus species. Habitat fragmentation threatens small habitats
in the San Francisco Bay, reducing genetic diversity and connectivity among populations (Wood et al., 2016).
There are different microclimates throughout parts of the Bay Area, allowing us to further discover how they
are affecting the Peromyscus species through urbanization. Using small mammals and next-gen sequencing
will determine if urbanization in the Bay Area, which includes San Francisco, San Jose, Oakland, and Marin
County, is causing evolutionary responses to the Peromyscus maniculatus

## Hypothesis 1: Our first hypothesis will revolve around Aim 1. We would take phenotypic traits to measure differences among urban deer mice populations. We can use an example such as body weight:

Example:

Null hypothesis (H₀): There is no significant difference in mean body weight among urban deer mice populations across different Bay Area cities.

Alternate hypothesis (H₁): There is a significant difference in mean body weight among urban deer mice populations across different Bay Area cities.

## Aim 1 - Phenotypic Differences Among Populations
Objective: Assess whether urban environments lead to measurable phenotypic variation in deer mouse populations

Approach:
Field sampling in multiple Bay Area cities
Collect morphological data: body length, tail length, ear length, and weight
Compare traits between urban populations to detect signs of local adaptation

Rationale:
Urban environments impose distinct selective pressures (e.g., temperature, habitat structure) that may drive rapid phenotypic evolution.

## ANOVA:
To test whether body weight differs among urban deer mice populations, I performed a one-way ANOVA with body weight as the response variable and city as the predictor. This analysis tests whether mean body weight varies significantly across different urban populations. I visualized the data using a boxplot with overlaid raw data points, employing a colorblind-friendly palette to ensure accessibility. Where assumptions of ANOVA were violated, I conducted a Kruskal-Wallis test as a non-parametric alternative, followed by post hoc pairwise comparisons where applicable.
